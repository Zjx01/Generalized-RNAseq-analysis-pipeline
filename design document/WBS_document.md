Calcium Neuron Imaging 

- Activity 1: Set up GitHub repository
  - [X] Task 1.1: Set up GitHub repository
  - [X] Task 1.2: Create high-level description document
  - [X] Task 1.3: Create code structure
- Activity 2: Build prototype I
  - Activity 2.1 : Refine design to describe tasks
    - [ ] Task 2.1.1: Break project into activities
    - [ ] Task 2.1.2: Break project into tasks
  - Activity 2.2: Define high-level functions
    - [ ] Task 2.2.1: Define read in data function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.2: Define data processing function 
    - [ ] Task 2.2.3: Define data analysis and visualization function 
  - Activity 2.3: Implement read data and save output and one feature in the analsyis
    - [ ] Task 2.3.1: Implement data downlaod function
    - [ ] Task 2.3.2: Implement seq data processing function: perform quality control and trim and alignment for reads.
          - [ ] generated fastq file and performed quality control, followed by trim and alignment for reads
          - [ ] the first implemmentation would be with a mockup input and a simple statement reporting whether the data is successfully processed.
          - [ ] the preprocessed data would be further visualized to search for differentially expressed gene checking between samples

    - [ ] Task 2.3.3: Implement pathway analysis: to found the possible pathways underlying the differenntially expressed genes.
  - Activity 2.4: Test prototype 
- Activity 3: Build prototype II
