# generalized RNAseq analysis pipeline

we aim to develop a general RNA-seq analysis workflow from bottom to up, starting from data downloading to differential gene expressions and follow-up pathway analysis, providing a reference manual and easing the tedious procedures. A major prominent part of the project is that the pipeline provides various visualization methods in gene enrichment and pathway analysis, contributing to the comprehension of the underlying biological pathogenesis.
