# generalized RNAseq analysis pipeline (under development)

we aim to develop a general RNA-seq analysis workflow from bottom to up, starting from data downloading to differential gene expressions and follow-up pathway analysis, providing a reference manual and easing the tedious procedures. A major prominent part of the project is that the pipeline provides various visualization methods in gene enrichment and pathway analysis, contributing to the comprehension of the underlying biological pathogenesis. 



The test case we use is for function sra_to_fastq is SRR5815077 and SRR5815077 (single-end sequenced RNA Seq data) you can download them with prefetch or mannually download them. The test data used for the downstream analysis is from package DOSE using data(geneList)

Data downloaded comandline: prefetch SRR5815077 SRR5815077
