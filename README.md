# Calcium Neuron Imaging 

Calcium imaging is adominant technique in modern neuronscience for measuring the activity of large population of neurons. Several challenge remain in how to best process and extract signals from these data, including extract the region of interest that correspond to individual neurons.

Here, we aim to develop a tool to recognize Calcium imaging in neurons using neuron calcium imaging data from the "CodeNeuron" challenge and try to determine the spatial distribution of active cells.
