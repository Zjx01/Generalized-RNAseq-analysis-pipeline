Brief description of dataset used for the project

1. Input data format for generalized RNA-seq pipeline should be RNAseq raw count data to find the differential expressed genes.
2. For downstream analysis geneList object is required for gene enrichment visualization.

the test case we use is for function find_DEG is included in the example data . The test data used for the downstream analysis is from package DOSE using data(geneList)
